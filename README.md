A converter for converting Java Card CAP files to JAR files

Currently this is just a handy wrapper around the JCDK3.0.4_ClassicEdition SDK distribution's normalizer utility.  It is subject to all the same caveats as the normalizer.bat interface (must have export EXP file and must be a Java Card 2.2.2 or lower applet).
